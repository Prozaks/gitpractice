My name is Yilkime Zakka Goter, A native of Ngas-Land,<strong> Kanke Local government Area of plateau state.</strong> I was born into the family of Zakka Goter, september 28th, in the year 1986. I attended LGEA primary school Gungji,<strong> Government secondary school Aloce,</strong> Akwanga LGA, Nasarawa state. I also attended plataeu state polytechnic Barkin Ladi where i obtained my Higher National Diploma in<strong> Urban and Regional Planning (URP).</strong>  I am happily married with successful children. All my siblings are hale and healthy, because of Gods mercies.

My period of staying in <em>Blockfuse Lab</em>  as a student of Web2 cohort learning programing has really exposed me alot in life entirely. I was made to understand that the <em>world is a global village</em>  and we are learning programming to compete with other programmers globally. The most important aspect of this program is that, there are<em> much opportunities for jobs</em> within and outside the country. The program is very interesting and alot of funs.
</p>
<p>
The most happy period of my life was when my wife gives birth to a child.<br> I was very happy because I was the only child of my mother,<br> and when I encourage my children to succeed, because of how I suffered.
</p>
<P>
I love and embrace Christianity, I'm making my children to be Christians through the <strong>power of Jesus </strong>and making him their lord and saviour , same I also did for my siblings. <strong>My duty is to preach the gospel,</strong> encourage those in faith and outside the faith. My advise to Nigerians is to <em>embrace peace, serve God.</em>
